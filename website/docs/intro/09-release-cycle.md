title: Release Cycle
---

Each major release has a two (2) month `Alpha` period, one (1) month `Beta`, before a full release and becomes `Stable`.
Each release goes into `Maintenance` after nine (9) months, as the next release enters `Alpha`.
This time period is chosen for alignment with AWS Lambda `nodejs` runtime releases.
All Node.js Long-Term Support (LTS) releases that have AWS Lambda runtimes are supported.
