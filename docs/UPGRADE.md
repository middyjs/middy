# Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x

See [CHANGELOG](/docs/CHANGELOG.md) for an overview of changes.

Version 3.x of Middy no longer supports Node.js versions 12.x. You are highly encouraged to move to Node.js 16.x.
With the Node.js version change all packages are now ECMAScript Modules along side CommonJS Modules.

## Notable changes
- New WebSocket middlewares
- HTTP & WebSocket Routers!
- Better error handling
- Timeout error handling
- Errors now use `{ cause }` for better context

## Core
- `onError` middleware stack order reversed to match `after` **[Breaking Change]**
  - If you only use `@middy/*` middlewares no change should be required
  - This change has trickle down effects on middlewares with `onError` (see below for details)
  - If you're handling errors yourself here are some things to review:
    - Attach near the end so it is triggered first (likely already done)
    - Remove `return response`, this will short circuit the response and block later middleware from modifying the response
- lambdaHandler now passes `{signal}` from `AbortController` to allow for ending lambda early to handle timeout errors
- `plugin` argument now supports:
  - `internal`: Allow the use of `new Proxy()` for smarter triggering in advanced use cases.
  - `timeoutEarlyInMillis`: When before lambda timeout to trigger early exit. Default `5`
  - `timeoutEarlyResponse`: Function to throw a custom error or return a pre-set value. Default `() => { throw new Error('Timeout') }`
- Added `.handler()` method to allow easier understanding of the execution cycle
- Deprecate `applyMiddleware()` and `__middlewares` **[Breaking Change]**

## Util
- `getInternal` error now includes `cause` set to an array of Errors
- Catch when `X-Ray` is applied outside of handler invocation scope
- `normalizeHttpResponse` now takes `request` and mutates response **[Breaking Change]**
- `getCache` will return `{}` instead of `undefined` when not found **[Breaking Change]**

    process.env.NODE_ENV = values.NODE_ENV
  })
```

# Upgrade 1.x -> 2.x

See [CHANGELOG](/docs/CHANGELOG.md) for an overview of changes.

Version 2.x of Middy no longer supports Node.js versions 10.x. You are highly encouraged to move to Node.js 14.x, 
which support ES6 modules by default (`export`), optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing operator (`??`) natively.

## Core
- In handler `callback(err, reponse)` have been removed for `async/await` support
  - `return response` to trigger `after` middleware stack  
  - `throw new Error(...)` to trigger `onError` middleware stack
- In middleware `next(err)` has been removed for `async/await` support
  - `throw new Error(...)` to trigger `onError` middleware stack
  - `return reponse` to **short circuit** any middleware stack and respond. v1.x currently throws an error when something is returned

## Middleware
### cache
Deprecated. Too generic and had low usage.

However, you can use the following if needed:
```javascript
const { createHash } = require('crypto')

module.exports = (opts) => {
  const storage = {}
  const defaults = {
    calculateCacheId: async (event) => createHash('md5').update(JSON.stringify(event)).digest('hex'),
    getValue: async (key) => storage[key],
    setValue: async (key, value) => {
      storage[key] = value
    }
  }

  const options = { ...defaults, ...opts }
  let currentCacheKey

  const cacheMiddlewareBefore = async (request) => {
    const cacheKey = await options.calculateCacheId(request.event)
    const response = await options.getValue(cacheKey)
    if (response) {
      return response
    }
    request.internal.cacheKey = cacheKey
  }

  const cacheMiddlewareAfter = async (request) => {
    await options.setValue(request.internal.cacheKey, request.response)
  }
  
  return {
    before: cacheMiddlewareBefore,
    after: cacheMiddlewareAfter
  }
}
```

### db-manager
Deprecated. Too generic and had low usage. You can check out [middy-rds](https://github.com/willfarrell/middy-rds) as a 
possible alternative or example on building your own replacement.

### [do-not-wait-for-empty-event-loop](/packages/do-not-wait-for-empty-event-loop/README.md)
No change

### function-shield
Deprecated. Only supported up to Node v10.

### [http-content-negotiation](/packages/http-content-negotiation/README.md)
No change

### [http-cors](/packages/http-cors/README.md)
Added new options to support more headers
- methods
- exposeHeaders
- requestHeaders
- requestMethods

### [http-error-handler](/packages/http-error-handler/README.md)
Added in support to honour httpError.expose. Errors with statusCode >= 500 are no longer applied to response by default.
Added new option to catch any non-http and statusCode >= 500 errors
- fallbackMessage


### [http-event-normalizer](/packages/http-event-normalizer/README.md)
No change

### [http-header-normalizer](/packages/http-header-normalizer/README.md)
No change

### [http-json-body-parser](/packages/http-json-body-parser/README.md)
No change

### [http-multipart-body-parser](/packages/http-multipart-body-parser/README.md)
No change

### [http-partial-response](/packages/http-partial-response/README.md)
No change

### [http-response-serializer](/packages/http-response-serializer/README.md)
No change

### [http-security-headers](/packages/http-security-headers/README.md)
No longer adds `statusCode:500` when there is no response.

### [http-urlencode-body-parser](/packages/http-urlencode-body-parser/README.md)
Remove `extended` option. Only uses `qs` as the parser, formally enabled by options `{extended: true}`.

### [http-urlencode-path-parser](/packages/http-urlencode-path-parser/README.md)
No change

### [input-output-logger](/packages/input-output-logger/README.md)
- Now additionally logs response from the `onError` middleware stack
- Support for omiting within nested arrays
- Add in support for `replacer` to be passed into `JSON.stringify()`

### [rds-signer](/packages/rds-signer/README.md)
New middleware to fetch RDS credential used when connecting with IAM roles. This was built into `db-manager`.

### [s3-key-normalizer](/packages/s3-key-normalizer/README.md)
No change

### [s3-object-response](/packages/s3-object-response/README.md)
New middleware to fetch and respond to S3 Object Get request event.

### [secrets-manager](/packages/secrets-manager/README.md)
Refactored, see documentation

### [sqs-json-body-parser](/packages/sqs-json-body-parser/README.md)
No change

### [sqs-partial-batch-failure](/packages/sqs-partial-batch-failure/README.md)
Replaced option `sqs` with `AwsClient` and added in more options for control.

### [ssm](/packages/ssm/README.md)
Refactored, see documentation

### [sts](/packages/sts/README.md)
New middleware to fetch assume role credentials.

### [validator](/packages/validator/README.md)
Upgraded `ajv` and it's plugins to support JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 specification. Defaults were change because of this.
- Plugin `ajv-keywords` removed from being included by default because it's quite a large package and usually only one keyword is used.
- Plugin `ajv-errors` removed from included by default because it conflicts with `ajv-i18n` when dealing with custom messages for multiple languages

### warmup
Deprecated. This was a work round for a missing feature in AWS Lambda. AWS added in the ability to use [provisioned concurrency](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-provisioned-concurrency-for-lambda-functions/)
on 2019-12-03, removing the need for this work around.

However, you can use the following if needed:
```javascript
middy(lambdaHandler)
  .before((request) => {
    if (request.event.source === 'serverless-plugin-warmup') {
      console.log('Exiting early via warmup Middleware')
      return 'warmup'
    }
  })
```


# Upgrade 0.x -> 1.x

## Independent packages structure

Version 1.x of Middy features decoupled independent packages published on npm under the `@middy` namespace. The core middleware engine has been moved to [`@middy/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/core) and all the other middlewares are moved into their own packages as well. This allows to only install the features that are needed and to keep your Lambda dependencies small. See the list below to check which packages you need based on the middlewares you use:

  - Core middleware functionality -> [`@middy/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/core)
  - `cache` -> [`@middy/cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/cache)
  - `cors` -> [`@middy/http-cors`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-cors)
  - `doNotWaitForEmptyEventLoop` -> [`@middy/do-not-wait-for-empty-event-loop`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/do-not-wait-for-empty-event-loop)
  - `httpContentNegotiation` ->  [`@middy/http-content-negotiation`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-content-negotiation)
  - `httpErrorHandler` ->  [`@middy/http-error-handler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-error-handler)
  - `httpEventNormalizer` ->  [`@middy/http-event-normalizer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-event-normalizer)
  - `httpHeaderNormalizer` ->  [`@middy/http-header-normalizer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-header-normalizer)
  - `httpMultipartBodyParser` ->  [`@middy/http-json-body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-json-body-parser)
  - `httpPartialResponse` ->  [`@middy/http-partial-response`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-partial-response)
  - `jsonBodyParser` ->  [`@middy/http-json-body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-json-body-parser)
  - `s3KeyNormalizer` ->  [`@middy/s3-key-normalizer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/s3-key-normalizer)
  - `secretsManager` ->  [`@middy/secrets-manager`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/secrets-manager)
  - `ssm` ->  [`@middy/ssm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/ssm)
  - `validator` ->  [`@middy/validator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/validator)
  - `urlEncodeBodyParser` ->  [`@middy/http-urlencode-body-parser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/http-urlencode-body-parser)
  - `warmup` ->  [`@middy/warmup`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@middy/warmup)


## Header normalization in `http-header-normalizer`

In Middy 0.x the `httpHeaderNormalizer` middleware normalizes HTTP header names into their own canonical format, for instance `Sec-WebSocket-Key` (notice the casing). In Middy 1.x this behavior has been changed to provide header names in lowercase format (e.g. `sec-webSocket-key`). This new behavior is more consistent with what Node.js core `http` package does and what other famous http frameworks like Express or Fastify do, so this is considered a more intuitive approach.
When updating to Middy 1.x, make sure you double check all your references to HTTP headers and switch to the lowercase version to read them.
All the middy core modules have been already updated to support the new format, so you should worry only about your userland code.


## Node.js 10 and 12 now supported / Node.js 6 and 8 now dropped

Version 1.x of Middy no longer supports Node.js versions 6.x and 8.x as these versions have been dropped by the AWS Lambda runtime itself and not supported anymore by the Node.js community. You are highly encouraged to move to Node.js 12 or 10, which are the new supported versions in Middy 1.x.
